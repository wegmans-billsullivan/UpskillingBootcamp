# ADR-001: Realtime Pricing updates for consumer purchasing of products

## Status

- Accepted (2022-25-03)

## Context
- Customers want to be able to subscribe to a service and be able to receive pricing updates on products that they are interested in to obtain the best possible price.
- Using Azure resources we can provide a solution that provides realtime messages to a Event Grid where message related subscribers can send SMS, or email messages to the consumer on price updates and act accordingaly on them for storage and processing with function apps.
- Storage queues, Function Apps and Event Grids can be utilized for this solution.

## Decision

- Use Azure Storage Queues, Event Grids, and Function Apps to facilitate the solution.

## Consequences

- Upstream source data should provide a streaming data source (Product and Price Event Grids)
- Event driven integration can be used to be made aware of pricing changes and act accordingly.
